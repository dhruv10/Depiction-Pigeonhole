##Depiction Pigeonhole

###Description 
An open source project that helps in research work via image classification through the means of crowdsourcing and machine learning algorithms.



###Problem Statement
Raw data image classification takes a lot of time and also tedious for humans because such data is generated in millions.
This makes processing of data very slow and scientist is slowed down in their research processes. 



###Solution 


###Existing Solution
Data classification through the means of crowdsourcing.



###Our innovation
-> We can train data by human inputs of classifying the images which can be used to train our machine learning models. 
They can further automate the process. hence saving time & research can be started earlier.
-> To increase the human brute force We are paying our users the amount of revenue that is being generated by Adsense & R&D donations.
